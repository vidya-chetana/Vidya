Sponsor scholarship and help underprivileged students complete their academic year.
The academic year is coming to an end, but if children do not pay the fees for the last semester, they will not be able to attend their final exam, resulting in loss of a year. You can uphold the hard work of socio-economically underprivileged children by sponsoring scholarship. Your contribution towards Vidya Chetana’s Scholarship Program will help these children pay the last semester fee and complete the academic year successfully. 
Education is important, but continuity in education is even more critical. Reportedly, the drop-out rate among students from socio-economically challenging backgrounds is quite persistent. According to a survey conducted by National Statistical Office, one out of every eight students in school or college drops out before completing their education, and this trend is higher in high schools. One of the many reasons for drop-out is poor economic condition of households. To address this situation and enable students to complete their education, the government has initiated several education schemes including scholarship for underprivileged students. These efforts are also being backed by NGOs, philanthropic organisations, and individual contributors. 
Vidya Chetana Scholarship Program is an initiative of Youth for Seva to support higher education of socio-economically underprivileged children. Your support will help children wanting to pursue PUC (10+2), Degree, Engineering, and Medical Courses. Your contribution towards Scholarship Program will help children continue their education as well as qualify you to receive tax exemption on your donated amount (₹500 & above).
